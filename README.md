# Spotify_Billboard_Hit_Prediction
Predicting Billboard's Year-End Hot 100 Songs using audio features from Spotify and lyrics from Musixmatch
# Introduction
In this work, we attempt to solve the Hit Song Science problem, which aims to predict which songs
will become chart-topping hits. We constructed a dataset with approximately 1.8 million hit and
non-hit songs and extracted their audio features using the Spotify Web API. We test four models on
our dataset. The underlying assumption
in HSS is that hit songs are similar with respect to their features. 
Hit prediction is useful to musicians, labels, and music vendors because popular songs generate larger revenues and
allow artists to share their message with a broad audience. For example, if a label would like to increase profits, they
may choose to invest their limited resource (ad campaigns, studio equipment, etc.) on tracks that are likely to become
popular. On the other hand, if an artist wants to embody an aesthetic that is devoid of mainstream musical characteristics,
they may choose to release tracks that are unlikely to become popular. We describe our approach to solve the HSS
problem in the proceeding sections.
